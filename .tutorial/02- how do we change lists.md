# Changing Lists

We can also change lists and the index. 


We built our list with `timetable =`, but we want to change index 4, "sport". We can do this by calling it with `[ ]`.

```python
timetable = ["Computer Science", "Math", "English", "Art", "Sport"]
print(timetable[0])
print(timetable[1])
print(timetable[2])
print(timetable[3])
print(timetable[4])
```

ðŸ‘‰ Add this to to the code above:

```python
timetable[4]= "Watch TV"
```


Why is it not printing correctly? I have created the timetable, printed it out, and changed index 4 of the timetable. 



ðŸ‘‰ However, I need to `print` the changed version. Let's `print` our new index:

```python
timetable[4]= "Watch TV"
print(timetable[0])
print(timetable[1])
print(timetable[2])
print(timetable[3])
print(timetable[4])
```

### Can you change another index and print the new list?
