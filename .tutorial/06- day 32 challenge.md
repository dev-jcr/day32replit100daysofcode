# ðŸ‘‰ Day 32 Challenge


- Create a list that stores greetings in different languages. Start with the language you speak.
- Then, go on the internet to find other greetings in other languages. [Here is a list of greetings](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/how-to-say-hello-in-10-different-languages) to get you started.
- Import `random` library. Generate a random number between 0 and maximum number of items in your list.
- At random, when the user clicks run, `print` one of the greetings.
- Use an f-string.

- Remember your first greeting is index 0.
- `print` a random greeting.
- You will only need four lines of code to make this project run!
